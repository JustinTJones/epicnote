# EpicNote #
This is in the very earliest stages of development.

Can be run by pointing a browser to index.html, preferably by hosting on a web server (some browsers, including Chrome, only allow running javascript through http or https).

I've been running it with a globally installed instance of Electron.
I will include a local version of Electron here soon.
